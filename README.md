# github4standards
## context
- the d^4 group recognise - as well as many others at BSI - that we may be able to use new tools to speed up standards making
- there is negligible barrier to trying github as a tool for this
- we have committees that are very technically competent, and may as well trial tools (github, wiki, other...)

## purpose
- determine if github works for early stage standards development
- learn the advantages and disadvantages in the tool and the way committees and BSI staff could use the tool
- what this is not
  - a tool for formal standards
- teach people in BSI about github

## principles
- we are not experts in github and the methods associated with using it, we need to find a champion to drive it
- this is a quick experiment
- if the trial doesn't work, we have learnt about the tool
- this is an experiment; it is not a secret and we should share what we are doing - without inflating it

## next steps
- DONE ~~identify someone to drive the project that knows github~~
  - GV
- clarify any support they need from us to trial
- work with them to develop their scope for the piece of work they are undertaking
  - scoping for standards around blockchain identity
   - create a BSIDLT1 organisation
   - invite members from the committee
   - SE to send template to GV, PF, DH
   - ask people to start working on it and commenting
   - basic training (or how to: add a comment, make an edit... / how to use it) / live session
- feed that back in to what we want to know about github as a standards platform
- talk to Microsoft about how we might be able to trial and use github in a more manageable way
- make sure I update KH - as well as DH
- DONE ~~inform AmS (SSM) who has been working on agile standards for covid response~~


## comments
- privacy concerns (usage patterns, personal data, etc)
  - an organisation can be created and only those members can see the private repository
- visibility to third party
- commercial risk
- security perimeter
- who could manipulate data?
- principle of BSI being independent, neutral and "holding the reigns"
- don't ask experts to sign agreements with others
- Testing a new line
