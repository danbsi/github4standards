# github4standards
## context
- the d^4 group recognise - as well as many others at bsi - that we may be able to use new tools to speed up standards making
- there is neglible barrier to trying github as a tool for this
- we have committees that are very technically competent, and may as well trial tools (github, wiki, other...)

## purpose
- determine if github works for early stage standards development
- learn the advantages and disadvantages in the tool and the way committees and bsi staff could use the tool
- what this is not
-- a tool for formal standards

## principles
- we are not experts in github and the methods associated with using it, we need to find a champion to drive it
- this is an quick experiement
- if the trial doesn't work, we have learnt about the tool
- this project is not a secret and we should share what we are doing - without inflating it

## next steps
- identify someone to drive the project that knows github
- clarify any support they need from us to trial
- work with them to develop their scope for the piece of work they are undertaking
- feed that back in to what we want to know about github as a standards platform
- talk to microsoft about how we might be able to trial and use github in a more manageable way
- what opportuntities and risks might this represent - are we thinking commericially, do we need to?
- inform Amanda Saunders (SSM) who has been working on agile standards for covid response
